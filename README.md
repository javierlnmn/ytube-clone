Green YouTube is a personal project aimed at providing a hands-on learning experience with React, one of the most popular JavaScript frameworks for building user interfaces. As an aspiring developer, the creator of Green YouTube sought to gain a deeper understanding of React's core concepts and explore its capabilities in the context of building a YouTube-inspired application.
